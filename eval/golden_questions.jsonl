Dryer lint near the HRV fresh air intake can be drawn into the HRV, clogging filters and reducing efficiency. The HRV outdoor intake and exhaust hoods should be located away from dryer vents, gas appliance exhausts, and other pollution sources. If they are close together, ensure the dryer vent has a proper lint trap and clean the HRV filters more frequently. Consider relocating one of the vents if problems persist.", "ground_truth_source": "69-RNC5-HEX-Owners-11-18-16.pdf", "confidence": "medium"}
{"id": 79, "category": "building_envelope", "question": "There's condensation on both the windows AND some interior walls. Is this the same cause or different?", "ground_truth": "Usually the same root cause: excess indoor humidity. Window condensation happens first because glass is the coldest surface. Wall condensation indicates either very high humidity or poor insulation in that wall section (creating a cold spot). Solutions: reduce indoor humidity (run HRV, use exhaust fans, check humidifier setting), improve ventilation. If wall condensation persists after humidity is controlled, investigate insulation gaps in that area.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "medium"}
{"id": 80, "category": "hvac", "question": "I have both a humidifier and want to know when to run it vs when to let the HRV handle humidity. What's the balance?", "ground_truth": "In heating season: run the humidifier to add moisture when indoor humidity drops below 30-35%. Use the HRV dehumidistat to remove excess moisture when humidity rises too high (causing condensation). They work together - the humidifier adds moisture for comfort, the HRV removes excess. Set humidistat based on outdoor temperature: colder outside means lower indoor humidity target to prevent condensation. In summer: turn off the humidifier water supply entirely.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "high"}

To check: turn off power, let water cool, locate anode rod on top of tank (hex head fitting), use 1-1/16 inch socket to unscrew. If rod is less than 1/2 inch thick or heavily corroded, replace it.

What are the common causes?", "ground_truth": "This is an electric water heater (Giant UG50) - it does not have a pilot light. Electric water heaters use heating elements, not gas burners. If the water heater is not producing hot water, check: the circuit breaker, the high-temperature cutoff reset button (red button on thermostat), and the heating elements.

{"id": 91, "category": "hvac", "question": "How does the Carrier OM9GFRC furnace two-stage heating work and what are the benefits?", "ground_truth": "Two-stage heating means the furnace has two heat output levels: low fire (first stage, ~60-70% capacity) and high fire (second stage, full capacity). The furnace runs on low stage most of the time, which provides more even heating, quieter operation, better humidity control, and higher efficiency. It only switches to high fire during very cold conditions when low fire cannot maintain the set temperature.

{"id": 92, "category": "plumbing", "question": "What does the hardness setting on my Fleck 5600 control, and how do I know if it's set correctly?", "ground_truth": "The hardness setting tells the softener how hard your incoming water is, which determines how much water can be softened before regeneration is needed. If set too low, the softener regenerates too infrequently and you get hard water breakthrough (water spots, scale). If set too high, it regenerates too often wasting salt and water. Get a water hardness test kit or ask your water utility for the hardness level (in grains per gallon), then set the control to match.", "ground_truth_source": "40106-fleck-5600-manual.pdf", "confidence": "medium"}

Is that normal and should I clean or replace it?", "ground_truth": "White crusty buildup is mineral scale from hard water - this is normal. However, heavy buildup reduces the pad's ability to absorb and evaporate water, reducing humidifier output. Replace the Vapor Pad at least once per year, or more often if you have hard water.
