{"id": 1, "category": "hvac", "question": "What furnace filter size do I need, and what MERV rating is appropriate for my system without restricting airflow too much?", "ground_truth": "Check the existing filter or furnace manual for exact size (common sizes: 16x25x1, 20x25x1, 20x20x1). MERV 8-11 is recommended for most residential systems - balances filtration and airflow. Higher MERV (13+) can restrict airflow and strain the blower unless your system is designed for it.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "high"}
{"id": 2, "category": "hvac", "question": "How often should I replace my furnace filter in winter vs summer, based on how dusty the house is and having pets?", "ground_truth": "With pets or dusty conditions: every 1-2 months in winter (heavy use), every 2-3 months in summer. Without pets in clean home: every 2-3 months in winter, every 3 months in summer. Check monthly and replace when visibly dirty.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "high"}
{"id": 3, "category": "hvac", "question": "My windows fog up and sometimes form water at -20C outside. What indoor humidity should I target and why?", "ground_truth": "At -20C outside, target 25-30% indoor humidity to prevent condensation. Condensation forms when warm moist air hits cold window surface. Lower humidity in extreme cold, higher (35-40%) in milder weather. Double-pane windows handle higher humidity than single-pane.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "high"}

Check filter first, then thermostat placement. If continues, call HVAC tech.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "medium"}

What could it be and when should I stop and call a pro?", "ground_truth": "Rattling: loose panel, debris in ducts, blower issue. Whistling: filter too restrictive, duct leak, return air blocked. Safe checks: tighten panels, check filter, ensure vents open. STOP and call pro if: smell gas, hear grinding/screeching, see sparks, furnace won't stay on.", "ground_truth_source": "general_knowledge", "confidence": "medium"}
